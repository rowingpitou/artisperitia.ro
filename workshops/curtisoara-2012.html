workshop: 2012
---
<p>This year's workshop saw a feminin team challenge the transformation of the old closets in a cozy house for the future craftsman of Curtisoara. After working on the project, they tackled different interventions on the building: correction of openings, window ajustments, insulation and clay plaster.</p>

<p>And with a perpetual smile!</p>

<p>Of course, the traditional special locals day was again a success with all our young friends from Curtisoara joining during the day to share games and activities together in this great museum.</p>
