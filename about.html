<h2>Artis Web Workshops: an active &amp; on-site practical approach</h2>

<p>How can we improve students&rsquo; education and offer them what no school can teach them? Artis is an organisation that promotes complementary practical learning through workshops. It values craftsmanship as an &ldquo;art of common sense&rdquo; and encourages the student&rsquo;s creativity on these bases. The social integration through the workshop is a constant, between participants as well as with the local population.</p>

<p>This web of workshops already includes Tibanesti, Curtisoara, Bran and Sinaia as workshop bases. &nbsp;This work will present the passed workshops, their results and their impact, and the future orientations of this project.</p>

<h2>Historic of the Artis Organisation</h2>

<p>One of the first steps leading to the creation of this Artis web was made in 2005. A French team of students in urban planning from Grenoble did an urban analysis of the city of Sinaia, and proposed four possible development scenarios. This successful experience was followed a few months later by the venue of ten Belgian students who participated in a workshop in Sinaia.&nbsp; This workshop was initiated by Stefan Bortnowski, architect, and Dan Sirbu, a local artist, and was supervised by Dan Manea, the local architect of Sinaia. It consisted of the rehabilitation of two centenary stone benches.&nbsp; The benches were part of a promenade with vista points created by king Carol I, between his castle in Sinaia and his brewery in Azuga.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following year, the association Artis Peritia was created and under its patronage, new workshops were organized.&nbsp; Two of them took place in Bran.&nbsp; One dealt with the urban analysis of the city and was meant to preserve the city from the uncontrolled sprawl generated by the development of investments in tourism.&nbsp; A group of students from Timisoara was involved in this workshop. The second was the ESUA (European School of Urbanism and Architecture) workshop.&nbsp; In parallel, a manifesto house was built by Serban Sturza, using only local materials such as wood, stone and earth, and put together by local craftsmen using traditional science in a modern project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In June 2007 a workshop along the same lines happened in Tibanesti. A group of Romanian students, designed and realised an extension of a small house in order to prepare for the venue of a french &ldquo;compagnon du devoir&rdquo;.&nbsp; This compagnon will be living there and teaching to locals the art of working with wood. In august 2007, Curtisoara was the centre of an international workshop.&nbsp; The students studied the landscape, the village of Curtisoara and the village museum, where the workshop took place.&nbsp; They then had a practical experience through restoration interventions on buildings of the museums.&nbsp; In 2008 and 2009, two more workshops in Curtisora and this summer will see the fourth edition of the Artis workshops in Curtisoara.</p>

<h2>Results of the passed workshops</h2>

<p>Up to now, students from four different countries have been participating to these workshops. &nbsp;The fact that all of them, once back in their respective schools, chose to organise a presentation of the workshop for their colleagues is a sign of success. &nbsp;The enthusiasm shown during the workshops is another one. &nbsp;<br />
One could say most schools asks their students to acquire a bit of practical experience on the construction site during the vacations. &nbsp;Where then does Artis demark itself? &nbsp;</p>

<p>The name Artis Web Workshops emphasises its characteristics. &nbsp;First of all, Artis organises workshops. &nbsp;This means it involves a group of students working together on a same project. &nbsp;The social exchange and the teamwork are constants in these workshops.</p>

<p>Another important statement lies in the Web part. &nbsp; Whereas other workshops already exist, Artis is the first organisation in Romania that emphasises a web of sites. &nbsp;The idea is to be able to use each particular site for its own particularities, and at the same time, to create links between the different workshops and places. &nbsp;The strength of Artis lies in this web. &nbsp;By creating a more complex organisation, it ensures a richer interaction between its poles. &nbsp;The idea is to give each pole a specific orientation. &nbsp;Curtisoara is intended to become in a near future a wood research centre, Bran concentrates on earth, while Tibanesti will be metal oriented. &nbsp;This web also gives Artis stronger arguments for funding programs. &nbsp;This web concentrates its efforts in the regions of Moldavia and Vallachia, two regions neglected on the restauration and promoting scale, compared to Transylvania where people are much more active.</p>

<p>The complete name of the association is Artis Peritia. &nbsp;It is thus not a question of art, but one about the art of trades, craftsmanship. Artis Peritia promotes craftsmanship as a vehicle of common sense. &nbsp;It has the objective to try and save a very valuable knowledge that is disappearing very fast in Romania. &nbsp;Not so much because of nostalgia of the past then for it&rsquo;s potential, as example, for the future. &nbsp;The XXIst century has begun with an irreversible awakening. &nbsp;Fossil energies, which have been the base of the last two centuries development, are not anymore &ldquo;unlimited&rdquo;. &nbsp;Moreover, we can already approximate when they will disappear. &nbsp;All our way of living will have to be adapted to this radical change. &nbsp;Europe promotes sustainability in every sector and architecture is one of the first one concerned. &nbsp;Facing this radical change, vernacular architecture can be considered as an example. &nbsp;Not to be taken literally, it offers us a summary of knowledge and of a kind of wiseness we can try to understand, and then apply to our modern context. &nbsp; But if we lose, through craftsmen, this centenary knowledge, we lose a unique knowledge. &nbsp;Artis Peritia is aware of this, and has thus focused on craftsmanship for this reason. &nbsp;Every student that is confronted to such an experience learns to understand and respect each trade and material at its right value. &nbsp;Peter Zumthor, a contemporary architect, once said he proposed architecture studies to be half theoretical, half practising in a crafts workshop. &nbsp;His projects reflect this very clearly.</p>

<p>This is also where the social interaction with the locals enters in focus. &nbsp;Artis attaches a lot of importance to the interaction with people living in the neighbourhood. &nbsp; During the last two workshops in Tibanesti and Curtisoara, a sculpture competition was organised for the young children of the village. &nbsp;Supervised by an artist, they sculpted wood and earth. &nbsp;The winners were invited to the next workshop, enabling them to discover another place in Romania thanks to this web. &nbsp;The result was very positive and created lots of new passions.</p>

<h2>Future orientations</h2>

<p class="p1">The Artis association is now a partner of the ESUA/EDUAC project, a Leonardo da Vinci European program. This share of experiences enables a larger range of activities and lectures during the workshops. In 2009, Claus Zapffe from Norway and Michael Mehaffy from the US came for two days during the workshop and brought a very valuable input on European projects and sustainability in the 21st century.</p>

<p class="p1">This project was built with the belief that it was opening a new path of experimentation in Romania based on what happens in other western countries. &nbsp;It proposes to learn from mistakes that have been done elsewhere and to directly apply what has proved to be successful instead of doing the same mistakes.</p>
