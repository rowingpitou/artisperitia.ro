<h1>Artis Peritia</h1>

<p>How can we improve students’ education and offer them what no school can teach them? Artis is an organisation that promotes complementary practical learning through workshops. It values craftsmanship as an “art of common sense” and encourages the student’s creativity on these bases. The social integration through the workshop is a constant, between participants as well as with the local population.</p>
